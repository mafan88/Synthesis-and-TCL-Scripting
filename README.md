[Design Compiler](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/rtl-synthesis-test/design-compiler-graphical.html) is a Synopsys synthesis tool. 


RTL design of a simple MIPS processor is here. then I try to modify its arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) to add one new instruction, and then synthesize the final description with your own constraints.
