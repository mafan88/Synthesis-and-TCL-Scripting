# Synthesis-and-TCL-Scripting
First of all you should read and understand the functionality of simple MIPS processor
and describe the implemented instructions inside its ALU. Then you should modify the
arithmetic unit and add another instruction with your own choice. You may choose the
instruction based on any application. Please explain your choice and the reason behind
or, you can add the following instruction to ALU of your processor (for this you need to
modify ALU to add one new opcode [just modify alu and alucontrol modules] to be able
to execute programs including new instruction). Simulate modified design with
Modelsim and verify the functionally of processor including your own instruction. In this
step automatic simulation and verification with TCL scripts is needed.
